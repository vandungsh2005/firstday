        <p>If you have played competitive FPS in the past (such as <span><a id="link1"
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/">CS:GO</a></span>) then
            you'll likely be familiar with the core gun mechanics in Valorant. Still, Valorant has plenty of its own
            unique mechanics, and a lot of that comes down to <span><a id="link1" href="./agents.html">Agent</a></span>
            abilities.</p>

            <h3 id="grid">Know Your Agent</h3>
            <p id="grid1">In Valorant, you control characters called <span><a id="link1"
                        href="./agents.html">Agents</a></span>. They each have special abilities that make them unique
                and give them advantages in certain combat situations.</p>
            <p id="grid1">There are four types of <span><a id="link1" href="./agents.html">Agents</a></span>: Sentinel,
                Initiator, Controller and Duelist.</p>
            <p id="grid1">There is plenty of utility in the 15 <span><a id="link1"
                        href="./agents.html">Agents</a></span> currently available, so knowing their abilities and what
                roles they specialize in will put you in the best position to succeed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-col s4">

            <h3 id="grid">Know Your Arsenal</h3>
            <p id="grid1">Like <span><a id="link1"
                        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/">CS:GO</a></span>,
                each round will begin with a buy period where you can purchase <span><a id="link1"
                        href="./weapons.html">weapons</a></span>. Knowing what each weapon does and where they can be
                useful will help inform you between rounds when stocking up.</p>
            <p id="grid1">For example, the Phantom is an excellent assault rifle for mid to long range combat. Its
                alternate fire (default Right Mouse Button) will let you ADS for higher accuracy, at the cost of some
                fire rate.</p>
            <p id="grid1">The buy screen will give you very detailed specifics about the damage, fire rate, and range of
                the weapon your mouse is hovering over.</p>

            <h3 id="grid">Try Out the Practice Range</h3>
            <p id="grid1">There are several ways to practice the ins and outs of Valorant outside of the initial
                tutorial. The shooting test will let you mess with your weapon sensitivity on the fly, but the open
                range is access to every single tutorial Valorant has to offer in one nice hub area.</p>
            <p id="grid1">It is highly recommended you check out the Open Range before diving into a game of Valorant!
                The open range gives you unlimited funds to try out the <span><a id="link1"
                        href="./weapons.html">weapons</a></span> and Agent abilities.</p>
            <p id="grid1">This will let you figure out which <span><a id="link1"
                        href="./weapons.html">weapons</a></span> you do and don't like for your playstyle. You can also
                try out any Agent here - even the ones you don't have unlocked.</p>

            <h3 id="grid">Dominate the Corners</h3>
            <p id="grid1">Valorant is all about getting the right angles in gunfights. The best way to get the drop on
                your enemies is to hug the corners! Peaking corners will let you find the best line of sight to either
                drop an ability or check on an enemy.</p>
            <p id="grid1"><span><a id="link1" href="./agents.html">Agents</a></span> like Brimstone specialize in
                dominating enemy lines of sight, using smoke bombs (pictured above) to block anyone trying to peak
                corners. If you found a spot with a perfect line of sight, chances are the enemies know it's there too.
                Always approach corners and new areas with caution, you never know what may be on the other side!</p>

            <h3 id="grid">Try Editing Your Crosshair</h3>
            <p id="grid1">One of the coolest personalization options that Valorant offers to you is the ability to
                customize your crosshair.</p>
            <p id="grid1">This is INCREDIBLY in depth, including the ability to change the color, opacity, width,
                length, and more! Take a second to change around the crosshair, or take it away completely. Whatever you
                want - it's your game!</p>

                style="width:100%">
            <h3 id="grid">Customization Tips</h3>
            <p id="grid1">Like any Free to Play game, Valorant is going to have plenty of cosmetic options. Right now in
                the beta, some skins can be purchased through the store using real money, but there are also a few skins
                that can be earned through gameplay.</p>
            <p id="grid1">If you activate a contract for an agent you already own, you will unlock cosmetics related to
                that Agent. If you activate for a contract for an agent you don't own, the final unlock will let you use
                the Agent in Valorant matches.</p>
            <p id="grid1">As Valorant evolves, so will its customization options. Be sure to earn whatever skins you are
                looking for.</p>
