        <h2>All Valorant Maps</h2>
        <h3>What are the Valorant maps?</h3>
        <p>Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter created by <span><a id="link1" href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot
                    Games</a></span>. So far there are five maps with one objective: planting or defending against a
            bomb (called a “spike”).</p>
        <p>The five playable maps are called Bind, Haven, Split, Ascent, and Icebox. There is also a shooting range
            where you can sharpen your aim or practice simulated situations like defending a spike you planted.</p>
        <p>Each map also has two ultimate orbs in neutral locations that teams can try to grab. The orb grants one point
            the ultimate of the agent who picked it up.</p>
        <p>In this article, we’ll give you quick overviews for each map and their points of interest.</p>
        <h3>Bind</h3>
        <span>
            <img id="img1" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/bind_map_callouts.jpg" width="550">
            <iframe width="687" height="330" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0zyIRv81Oc"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <p>Bind is a two site map (A and B) that has attackers infiltrating from a beach coast.
            Site A is accessible through an alleyway in the middle of the map called “short A” or through a building’s
            hallway called, “showers”.
            Site B is accessible by a path along the beach called “long B” or through a marketplace and window called
            “hookah”.</p>
        <p>A unique aspect of this map is that there are two one-way teleporters. One teleporter takes you from long B
            to the attacker’s side of showers. The other takes you from short A to the attacker’s side of hookah.
            These allow both attackers and defenders alike to quickly rotate or flank the opposing team.
            The teleporter is incredibly noisy so it is somewhat risky to do so if your enemies are expecting it. You
            can also throw projectiles, drones, and guns through teleporters.
            One ultimate orb can be found inside the showers while the other is at long B right in front of the
            teleporter.</p>

        <h3>Haven</h3>
        <span>
            <img id="img1" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/haven_callouts.jpg" width="550">
            <iframe width="687" height="330" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkmNf2rjN24"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <p>Haven is a three site map (A, B, C), which is also its unique aspect as most bomb/defusal maps in FPS games
            tend to be two sites.
            Site A is accessible through an L-shaped’ alleyway called “long A” or through an underground passage called
            “sewers” (A-short).
            As expected, long A is more suited for long-ranged engagements while the sewers will bring close quarter
            combat.</p>
        <p>Site B is accessible through a window which leads into an outdoor courtyard. The courtyard also leads to a
            set of doors called “garage” which allows attackers to wrap around to Site B.
            The garage also acts as a connector to Site C, so attackers that make it through can threaten both B and C.
            The other entry point to Site C is through a straight alleyway called “long C”. Long C has a cubby partway
            through so attackers can use smokes to advance safely.
            The two ultimate orbs can be found at Site A outside of long A or at Site C outside of long C.</p>

        <h3>Split</h3>
        <span>
            <img id="img1" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/split_callouts.jpg" width="550">
            <iframe width="687" height="330" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M5VIT0zP7I"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <p>Split was added as of the first day of closed beta. Its two sites are on the far left and right sides of the
            map with a middle area that provides high ground dominance.</p>
        <p>The unique mechanic here is that there are ropes that allow players to quickly ascend or descend quietly –
            you can find them at A Sewer, B Rafters, and Mid Vent.
            The ultimate orbs can be found at at A main and within B main, also known as the garage.</p>

        <h3>Ascent</h3>
        <span>
            <img id="img1" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/ascent.jpg" width="550">
            <iframe width="687" height="330" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MjW98TDkNY"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <p>Ascent was the first new map to be added since Valorant’s official release.
            It’s a two site map that is located in Venice, Italy.
            Compared to the other maps, Ascent has the most open area with a large courtyard at the center of the map.
        </p>
        <p>The courtyard offers a quick short cut to the sides of the map but is risky to cross since it doesn’t contain
            that much cover.
            Another signature feature that is unique to Ascent is its closeable doors.
            At each defensive site, there is a door that can be open or closed using a switch.
            The door is armored but can be broken.</p>

        <h3>Icebox</h3>
        <span>
            <img id="img1" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/06/709cca30-icebox_callouts.jpg"
                width="550">
            <iframe width="687" height="330" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX39lspy7DM"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <p>Icebox was released at the beginning of Act III and takes place in a tundra climate. The map has a ton of
            verticality and angles to cover so it’s the most complex map released yet.
            There are unique features such as horizontal ropes (that work identically to Split’s vertical ropes) and
            two-tiered planting sites, meaning that you have a low ground option to plant on and a high ground one.</p>
        <p>It’s a great map for agents like Raze, Jett, and Omen that are able to make good use of all the boxes while
            agents like Sova and Cypher may struggle. Sova because it will be easy to hide from his sonar arrow and
            Cypher because there are many access points so his Trapwires may not get as much value as usual.</p>

        <h3>Shooting Range</h3>
        <p>The last existing map is dedicated to practicing and honing your skills. Here, you can change your agent and
            guns at any time (you can even test characters that you do not own yet).</p>
        <span>
            <img id="img1" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/shooting-range.jpg" width="625">

                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <p>At the shooting range, you can shoot at dummies that spawn at different speeds and settings such as strafing.
        </p>
        <p>There is also an area dedicated to shooting long-distance targets to test the effective range of guns.</p>
        <p>Lastly, you can also practice scenarios such as planting a spike and then defending against bots to improve
            your composure and ability in clutch situations.</p>
