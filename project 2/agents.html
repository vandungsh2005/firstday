        <h2>A Beginner’s Guide to All Valorant Agents</h2>
        <h3>What are Valorant agents?</h3>
        <p>Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter where each player plays as a character called an “agent”.</p>
        <p>There are currently fifteen agents in the game: Astra, Breach, Brimstone, Cypher, Jett, Killjoy, Omen,
            Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Sage, Skye, Sova, Viper, and Yoru.</p>
        <p>Each agent has four unique abilities (including one ultimate).</p>
        <p>So far, the agent abilities range from traditional utility from realistic shooters such as flashbangs and
            smoke grenades but also include magical/futuristic themed abilities like conjuring walls and sonic arrows
            that act like a radar.</p>
        <h3>How Valorant abilities work</h3>
        <p>Each character gets an ability they can use for free each round.</p>
        <p>The two other non-ultimate abilities must be purchased at the gun shop during the buy phase like you would a
            grenade in <span><a id="link1"
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/">CS:GO</a></span>.</p>
        <p>This means that they have finite uses meaning that players should use them conservatively. Abilities cannot
            be spammed on cooldown like you can in <span><a id="link1"
                    href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Lastly to cast an ultimate, you need a certain amount of skillpoints. Skill points can be grabbed around the
            map (gives one to all team members), earned through kills (1 kill = 1 point), or passively with each round.
        </p>
        <h3>All Valorant Characters (so far)</h3>
        <h4>Astra</h4>
        <p>Astra debuted as one of the most unique agents in Valorant due to her abilities that you can place anywhere
            on the map.</p>
        <p>She’s a controller that can play the game like a chess match, being able to set her team up with smokes,
            stuns, and blackholes.</p>

        </span>
        <h4>Breach</h4>
        <p>Breach is designed to be an initiator who excels at playing through walls and opponents that are positioned
            to hold chokepoints.</p>
        <p>His mechanics go through terrain and across the map to CC and kill enemies.</p>

        </span>
        <h4>Brimstone</h4>
        <p>Brimstone is a tactical commando with versatile abilities that involve using the minimap.</p>
        <p>He can call down smoke grenades, fire napalms that act like molotovs, buff allied agents with additional
            firepower, and call down an airstrike</p>

        </span>
        <h4>Cypher</h4>
        <p>Cypher is a spy who’s a master of gathering information through his camera and trip wires.</p>
        <p>He’s great on defense as he can hold a lot of real estate on his own, but he can also be useful on offense
            since by limiting potential flank routes or making preventing a defusal easier.</p>

        </span>
        <h4>Jett</h4>
        <p>Jett is the most mobile agent in Valorant, making her an ideal duelist, especially when she gets her knife
            ultimate.</p>
        <p>She doesn’t provide much utility outside of a smoke grenade but she can dash to engage/disengage or get up to
            high positions with her boost jump.</p>
        <span>

        </span>
        <h4>Killjoy</h4>
        <p>Killjoy is a German genius who uses an arsenal of turrets, mines, and traps.</p>
        <p>She provides an incredible amount of information gathering, area control, and is the only agent that can
            disarm her enemies.</p>

        </span>
        <h4>Omen</h4>
        <p>Omen is a flanker who is able to get behind enemy lines with teleports and strike from sneaky angles.</p>
        <p>He has some utility in the form of a smoke grenade and another ability that can go through walls and obscure
            the vision of enemies.</p>

        </span>
        <h4>Phoenix</h4>
        <p>Phoenix is a pyromancer with an explosive playstyle, utilizing fire to control the flow of battle. He can use
            them to create walls, as flashbangs around corners, and of course, as an AoE molotov.</p>
        <p>Naturally, he has an ultimate that suits his name as he can activate it, fight and die, and then come back to
            life where he originally activated it.</p>
        <span>
            <img id="img2" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/phoenix-character-select.jpg"

        </span>
        <h4>Raze</h4>
        <p>Raze is the de facto explosives expert of Valorant with some of the most kill potential in the game.</p>
        <p>Her kit has everything from a remote detonated grenade and a cluster bomb to a rocket launcher and even an
            exploding Roomba-like robot.</p>
        <span>
            <img id="img2" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/raze-agent-select.jpg" width="625">

        </span>
        <h4>Reyna</h4>
        <p>Reyna is a vampire whose abilities are fueled by kills.</p>
        <p>What she lacks in utility is made up for by her raw killing power.</p>
        <p>She can inflict Nearsight on her enemies, heal herself, turn intangible, and even turn invisible.</p>
        <p>As a result, she’s one of the best duelists and skirmishers in the game.</p>
        <span>

        </span>
        <h4>Sage</h4>
        <p>Sage is currently the only “healer” in Valorant with a defensively-oriented kit, with a healing orb she can
            use on herself or an ally.</p>
        <p>She’s able to use ice abilities to slow and block off her enemies (her ice wall can also be used to boost
            allies to high ground).</p>
        <p>She has one of the most powerful ultimates in the game with a resurrection.</p>
        <span>
            <img id="img2" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/sage-character-select.jpg"

        </span>
        <h4>Skye</h4>
        <p>Skye hasn’t been released just yet but will be making her debut two weeks into Act III’s launch.</p>
        <p>Flavor-wise, she’s a Druid-like commando that uses animal-based trinkets.</p>
        <p>She’s an Initiator + Support hybrid that can help her team by engaging, scouting, and healing.</p>
        <span>

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <h4>Sova</h4>
        <p>Sova is a master archer who is able to bounce his arrows to scout enemies or kill them around corners. He
            also has a handy owl drown that can be used to mark where an enemy is.</p>
        <p>He can use his ability to track his opponents in combination with his ultimate, which allows him to fire
            three bursts of lightning through walls.</p>
        <span>
            <img id="img2" src="https://cdnportal.mobalytics.gg/production/2020/04/sova-character-select.jpg"

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <h4>Viper</h4>
        <p>Viper wields toxic gases that run off of a refillable reserve. She can emit poison from a grenade or create a
            line wall with the vapors.</p>
        <p>Her ultimate basically creates a poison “room”, making her a great bomb planter.</p>
        <span>

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </span>
        <h4>Yoru</h4>
        <p>Yoru is a tricky duelist that is built to lurk, acting as the worst nightmare to potential flankers.</p>
        <p>He’s a contender for having one of the highest skill caps due to his unique abilities that rely on having
            knowledge of the map, the flow of a match, and where opponents are likely to be.</p>
        <span>
